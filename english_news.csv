A tropical trough, or wave, becomes a depression  when its winds start swirling.  When sustained winds reach 39mph, the system becomes a  named tropical storm.  It reaches hurricane status when sustained winds hit 74mph.

Clerks are  trained to say ""please"" and ""thank-you"" as well  as observing new standards of  cleanliness. The ingredients used at the restaurant are provided by Soviet farms, but  McDonald's provided farmers with special training and disease-resistant seeds for the  process. At 3.75 rubles (around five U.S. dollars) for a Big Mac, feeding a family at  McDonald's could cost the average Soviet worker two-day's wages.","The Big Mac debuted to mixed review as McDonald's opened restaurants in Korea, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and China. Large crowds stood in line for hours at openings in Belgrade, Moscow, and Peking. Customers in Yugoslavia, the first communist country to get a McDonald's, and China raved about the taste of the Big Mac. In Moscow, the Russians were less enthusiastic about its taste but gave a thumbs up to the shakes. The openings came after long negotiations which, in most cases, saw McDonald's contracting with local farmers for the beef, potatoes and other supplies needed for its restaurants.","The expansion of McDonald's into communist countries and the cultural impact of its introduction of the Big Mac.

His resignation  reinforces suspicion among liberals that Mrs. Aquino is not as committed to social  change as they expected when she took power in 1986.   Abad's difficulties began in February when he tried unsuccessfully to block the lease of  government land to Japan's Marubeni Corp., for an industrial park, believing the land  should be distributed instead to peasants. Abad's stand, alarmed landowners in Congress,  and lawmakers on the Commission on Appointments who belong to the pro-Aquino party  blocked his appointment through eight hearings.","With military firepower, President Aquino ended the Oct. 4-6 uprising.

In the last decade several big storms have veered away from South Carolina, and  officials feared that the latest warnings wouldn't be heeded. Instead, tens of  thousands in Charleston and the three surrounding counties went to shelters or  evacuated inland.","The two largest property insurance companies in the Carolinas, State Farm and  Nationwide, estimate Hurricane Hugo losses at $600 million, making it the costliest  hurricane ever.
