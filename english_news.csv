However,  the U.S. Ambassador to Bonn predicted that reunion could occur relatively soon.   Because East Germany is the Soviet's most important Warsaw Pact satellite, Moscow  may not be so agreeable.","Political unrest and a collapsing economy prompted tens of thousands of skilled East  German workers to rush through recently opened borders to West Germany.
