Benazir Bhutto, leader of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) was elected as Pakistan's Prime 
Minister on December 2, 1988.  Ms. Bhutto is the 35-year old daughter of the late Prime Minister 
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who was ousted in a 1977 coup and executed by President Mohammed Zia 
ul-Haq. Zia died in a plane crash August 17, 1988, which appeared to be sabotage.

Members of Pakistan's National Assembly under Ms. Bhutto became involved in the issue of 
democracy and dynasty.  She was charged with trying to build a political dynasty by appointing 
family members to her government positions, being a dictator, a traitor, and an agent of the 
Russians and Indians.  She was also questioned about her intentions regarding a nuclear program 
agreement with the U.S.  She became involved in a family feud with her mother, Nusrat, whom 
she removed as co-chair of the PPP.  Her brother Murtaza was imprisoned and charged with 
running anti-government terrorism campaign while in exile.  In 1989, squabbling in the 
provinces interfered with her public works program and her husband was arrested for alleged 
involvement in extortions and illegal bank loans.  In August 1990, under military pressure, she 
was removed, accused of corruption, nepotism, and political ineptitude.</SUM>
