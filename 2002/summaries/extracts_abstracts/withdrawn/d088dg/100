Benazir Bhutto, leader of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), was elected Pakistan's Prime 
Minister on December 2, 1988. Ms. Bhutto is the daughter of Prime Minister Zulfiker Ali 
Bhutto, ousted in a 1977 coup.

Under Ms. Bhutto, members of Pakistan's National Assembly became involved in the issue of 
democracy and dynasty. She was charged with trying to build a dynasty by appointing family 
members to key government positions. She publicly feuded with her mother and brother, and her 
husband was arrested for extortion. Squabbling in the provinces disrupted her public works 
program. She left office in August 1990 under military pressure.</SUM>
