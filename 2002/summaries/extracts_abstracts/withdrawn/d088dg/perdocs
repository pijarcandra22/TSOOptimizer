Benazir Bhutto, leader of the People's Democratic Party, on Thursday promised to end the 
"reactionary" legacy of late President Zia ul-Haq if she is elected.  Zia died in an August 17 
plane crash.

Ms. Bhutto is the 35-year old daughter of the late  Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was 
ousted in a 1977 coup and ordered hanged.  Her party is pitted against the nine-party Islamic 
Democratic Alliance, which says Ali Bhutto committed political murders, jailed his opponents, 
and denied a wide range of freedoms.  Ms. Bhutto has accused the Alliance and Zia loyalists of 
having a poor human rights record.</SUM>

Members of Pakistan's National Assembly are involved in the issue of democracy and dynasty 
under Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who they charge with trying to build a political dynasty by 
appointing family members to key government positions.  The Bhuttos has been out of power 
since Benazir's father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was executed after a military coup in 
1977.

An American consultant to the assembly says there is a rebirth of democracy but "it remains in 
its infancy."  Western diplomats and Pakistani analysts see growing signs of corruption and 
patronage, and complain that Bhutto's government is obsessed with political gamesmanship.</SUM>

About 50,000 people today marked the first anniversary of the death of President Mohammed 
Zia ul-Haq by holding an anti-government rally denouncing his successor, Benazir Bhutto.  Zia 
died in a plane crash August 17, 1988 which appeared to be sabotage.  He had seized power in a 
1977 coup ousting and executing Ms. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.

Pakistani officials have blamed hundreds of terrorist attacks in recent years on Soviet-trained 
agents of Afghanistan's communist government.  Zia was a supporter of anti-communist Afghan 
guerrillas.

Zia loyalists accuse Benazir Bhutto of civilian dictatorship, being a traitor, and an agent of the 
Russians and Indians.</SUM>

Benazir Bhutto charged Wednesday that powerful army generals forced her ouster as prime 
minister.  She warned that the army will take over in a few weeks.  Military and government 
officials denied the charges, insisting that general elections will be held October 24.  They said 
Bhutto, her family and close aides will be barred from leaving the country pending investigations 
of corruption.

Bhutto's aides said the investigations might be used to prevent her from taking part in the 
elections.  She said "major differences" developed over the army chief of staff's demands to 
crack down on urban violence in her home province.</SUM>

The husband of ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, businessman Asif Ali Zardari, was 
arrested in Karachi for alleged involvement in extortion and illegal bank loans.  He has been a 
major target of investigations since Bhutto's dismissal for allegedly heading an administration 
riddled with corruption, nepotism and abuse of power.  Ms. Bhutto says the arrest is to intimidate 
and blackmail her.  She visited Zardari at a police interrogation center and later appeared before 
a special court in Lahore, where she faces charges of wrongdoing.

Both Bhutto and Zardari are running the October Assembly elections, but she could be barred if 
convicted.</SUM>

Nusrat Bhutto and her son Murtaza Bhutto are involved in a family feud with Benazir Bhutto, 
Pakistan's Prime Minister.  The feuding was triggered after police fired on demonstrators 
Wednesday attempting to march to the grave of former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to 
celebrate his 66th birthday.

Benazir removed her mother, Nusrat, as co-chair of the ruling Pakistan's People's Party.  
Murtaza faces charges of running an anti-government terrorism campaign during 16 years of 
self-imposed exile.  The feud erupted this week when Murtaza's supporters refused to let Benazir 
visit her father's grave unless he was released to preside over the celebration.</SUM>

The Pakistan People's Party (PPP) is not at its best.  There are embarrassing items of omission 
and commission and widespread skepticism about how confident a grip the Benazir Bhutto 
government has over the issues needing effective handling.

 What is undermining the PPP's administrative image is the family feud, which shows no sign of 
abating.  Ms. Bhutto is apparently trying damage limitation.  However, the real damage to the 
PPP is its own workers hurling thoughtless and undignified accusations at Nusrat Bhutto.  Ms. 
Bhutto should sort out family misunderstanding in private and clear the questions of 
"succession." The PPP is not Bhutto's family property.</SUM>

Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said the question of rolling back Pakistan's peaceful nuclear 
programs does not arise because the nation's defense depends upon it.  She also asked the United 
States to review its decision on the use of the Pressler Amendment, which stopped military and 
economic aid to Pakistan.

US and European nations objections to nuclear programs are limited to the Islamic world.  Soon 
after Benazir Bhutto's statement, Washington indicated that the amendment would end.  How 
did it suddenly become useless?  Benazir Bhutto should remove all doubts and skepticism about 
intentions to make an agreement with the US over the nuclear program.</SUM>

The National Assembly held a session inn Islamabad today at which the Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto welcomed the opposition's decision to end the boycott of the Assembly.  She invited the 
opposition and other political party leaders for discussion on economic issues.  Regarding her 
challenge to the opposition for submitting resignations, she said she was confident they would 
not.

She said strict action will be taken against those responsible for the parliament building fire.  The 
situation of terrorist training in the Sindh province will be tackled politically and Karachi's 
problems will be resolved by providing drinking water, more electricity, transport and hospitals.</SUM>
