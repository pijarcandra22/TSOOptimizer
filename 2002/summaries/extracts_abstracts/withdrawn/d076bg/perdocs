Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev argued 
passionately over a range of topical subjects during a four-hour meeting.  According to a 
Thatcher spokesman, Thatcher asked Gorbachev about a Washington report that Moscow 
sold up to 15 long-range fighter-bombers to Libya, which Britain accuses of sponsoring 
terrorism.  Gorbachev did not respond.  When Thatcher accused the Soviets of not being 
completely frank about their chemical weapons arsenal, Gorbachev replied, "We have to 
try better to convince each other." Thatcher believes deterrence of nuclear weapons 
prevents war and also disagreed with Gorbachev's goals of eliminating all nuclear 
weapons from Europe.</SUM>

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has announced she plans to step down after she leads 
her Conservative Party to a fourth successive election but was unlikely to try for a fifth.  
Critics say she has weakened her position and given the opposition a lead for success 
well before the actual race.  The next election must be held by the summer of 1992, but 
Mrs. Thatcher is expected to call it in 1991.

It is speculated that she would step down by 1994, the year she would celebrate her 69th 
birthday and her husband his 79th. Age may be a factor in her decision.</SUM>

A political sensation in Britain has been caused by Defense Minister Michael Heseltine's 
challenge to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for leadership of the Conservative Party. 
The first vote of Tory Members of Parliament is scheduled for today.  If Heseltine wins 
control of the party, Mrs. Thatcher would have to give up the Prime Minister's job she 
has held since 1979.

The editorial comment that has stirred Britain calls for: Mrs. Thatcher to stand down and 
preserve her achievements; the Party to rally to her support; rejecting her for not 
supporting European unity; support of Heseltine to defeat the opposition.</SUM>

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's international admirers praised her courage and 
achievements Thursday after she announced she would resign.  Even her foes tempered 
scorn with praise for a formidable adversary. Criticism concerned the reluctance she 
showed toward increasing European unity; the Persian Gulf crisis; and the 1982 
Falklands War with Argentina.  Otherwise positive comments came from President Bush 
for being, "an outstanding ally of the United States."; France for marking "an important 
moment in the history"..of Europe"; South Africa for her opposition to sanctions on that 
country; Australia for her "courage and tenacity of purpose; and Japan for her firm 
convictions.</SUM>

Former President Reagan heaped praise on British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
after she announced her impending retirement.  She succumbed to the challenge mounted 
by Michael Heseltine.

Reagan and the Iron Lady formed a formidable duo in the 1980s at international 
gatherings. Reagan was always grateful for her support of his conservative approach to 
foreign affairs. He sided with her on the Falkland Islands affair, and she supported him 
on the US bombing of Libya.  She backed him on her efforts to install MRBMs in Europe 
and his hard line toward the Soviet Union, and both warmed up quickly to Soviet 
President Gorbachev.</SUM>

For almost a decade, the White House regarded Margaret Thatcher as America's best 
friend whose views supported its conservative tone. She supported the US bombing of 
Libya; the Persian Gulf crisis; Reagan's free-market capitalism, hard line toward 
Moscow, efforts to install medium-range missiles in Europe, and rocky relations with 
organized labor.  This special relationship with Washington slipped when Bush came to 
power.  Mrs. Thatcher suddenly seemed to be just one of the gang.

Bush disagreed with Thatcher's decision to deport Vietnamese and Cambodian boat 
people, found German Chancellor Kohl more interesting than she did, and was not as 
warm to the Soviet leader.</SUM>

President Bush lost an irreplaceable pin supporting his mission in the Persian Gulf when 
he heard of Margaret Thatcher's resignation.  She concluded she had to go after her own 
Cabinet members told here they could not support her in her party's second round of 
balloting. A loss was expected at the next election because of opinion polls, bad 
economic news, and an unpopular new tax.

President Bush, who began his term without much trust in her, was generous in his praise. 
They had a pragmatic relationship of mutual respect and support that benefited both, 
especially after her support during the Persian Gulf crisis.</SUM>

Margaret Thatcher set the example of what a woman could achieve in British society, but 
her critics say she did little else than to help women along.  Mrs. Thatcher said she 
viewed herself as prime minister, not as a woman. She was no believer in feminism and 
angered feminists by often emphasizing woman's traditional role of homemakers and 
caregivers.

Several females were appointed to junior executive posts in various ministries but only 
one served in her cabinet. Mrs. Thatcher introduced some helpful legislation: tax 
concessions for workplace nurseries; independent taxation for married women; 
legislation to compel absent fathers to pay child benefits.</SUM>

Queen Elizabeth awarded former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher the Order of Merit 
and made her husband a baronet. They will be formally referred to as Sir Denis and Lady 
Thatcher. Palace insiders say one reason for the quick award was the queen's desire to 
demonstrate there is no animosity between Britain's two most prominent women, putting 
to rest rumors they did not get along.  With the OM, Thatcher can continue to serve in the 
House of Commons as the member from the North London constituency of Findley. She 
eventually should be made a heredity countess, in Britain the female equivalent to an earl.</SUM>
