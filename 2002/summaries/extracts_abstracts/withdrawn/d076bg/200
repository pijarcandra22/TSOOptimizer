Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher plans to step down in 1991 after she leads her Conservative 
Party to a fourth consecutive election: thus giving up the job she has held since 1979. She has 
received tempered criticism for her reluctance toward increasing European unit, the Persian Gulf 
crisis, the 1982 Falklands War with Argentina, and failure to support feminism. Some say her 
Party will lose because of bad economic news, an unpopular new tax, and the belief she 
weakened her Party by announcing her retirement too soon.

Otherwise, international admirers have praised her courage and achievements. The United States, 
in particular, was grateful for her support in the bombing of Libya, the Persian War Crisis, free-
market capitalism, efforts to install MRBMs in Europe, and a hard line toward Moscow.  She 
warmed up to Gorbachev but disagreed with his goals of eliminating all nuclear weapons from 
Europe.

Despite feminist criticism, Mrs. Thatcher introduced some helpful legislation: tax concessions 
for workplace nurseries; independent taxation for married women; legislation to compel absent 
fathers to pay child benefits. Queen Elizabeth awarded her the Order of Merit that means she will 
be formally referred to as Lady Thatcher and may serve in the House of Commons.</SUM>
