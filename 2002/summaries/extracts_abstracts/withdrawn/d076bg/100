Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher plans to step down after she leads her Conservative Party to a 
fourth consecutive election. She is not expected to win; namely, because of bad economic news, 
an unpopular new tax, failure to support feminism, reluctance to support European unity, and 
support of the Falklands War and the Persian Gulf crisis.  She has been praised, however, by 
international admirers. The United States, in particular, is grateful for her hard line toward 
Moscow. Queen Elizabeth awarded her the Order of Merit, giving her the title of Lady Thatcher 
and authority to serve in the House of Commons.</SUM>
