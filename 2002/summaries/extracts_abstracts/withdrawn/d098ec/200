The Hubble Space Telescope was named for Edwin Hubble, an astronomer whose work 
in the 1920s figured into the theory that a "Big Bang" shaped the universe. The telescope 
is the size of a railroad tank car and includes highly sensitive scientific instruments. It is 
considered the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo's first telescope. It will 
provide images of better resolution and sensitivity then ground-based telescopes. 
Astronomers are eagerly awaiting results.

The original launch was set for 1983. delays set it back seven years. On 24 April 1990 
Discovery carried Hubble into an orbit 380 miles above the earth, high above the earth's 
atmosphere that limits ground-based telescopes.

The launch went well, but problems developed once orbit had been reached. The 
telescope's release from Discovery was delayed by difficulty in unfurling a solar pane.  A 
later malfunction that occurred after the cover of the large camera was removed caused 
an electronic system shutdown. The telescope was orbiting on its own, and the Discovery 
astronauts prepared for a 29 April landing. Controllers are working cautiously to insure 
that Hubble's 15-year stay in space will fulfill the expectations of the astronomers.</SUM>
