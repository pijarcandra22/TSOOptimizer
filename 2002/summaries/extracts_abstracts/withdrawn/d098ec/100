The Hubble Space Telescope was named for astronomer Edwin Hubble. It carries many 
sensitive scientific instruments and operates above the earth's atmosphere. It is 
considered the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo's first telescope.

Shuttle Discovery carried Hubble into space on 24 April 1990. Hubble's release from the 
shuttle was delayed by a balky solar panel, and later Hubble suffered an electronics 
system shutdown. Hubble was operating on its own, and controllers were working 
cautiously to correct the problems and insure that Hubble would meet the high 
expectations of the astronomers. A 15-year stay in space is planned.</SUM>
