<s docid=AP900421-0075 num=12 wdcount=35> Two weeks after a failed launch 
attempt, an improved Discovery is ready to embark on one of the most momentous 
shuttle missions, hoisting the Hubble Space Telescope high enough to behold the 
threshold of time.</s

<s docid=AP900424-0048 num=37 wdcount=21> The telescope is named for the late 
astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe is 
expanding.</s>

<s docid=AP900424-0048 num=30 wdcount=26> In addition to the $1.5 billion cost 
of Hubble, $500 million has been spent on spare parts, astronaut training and 
computer software to operate the instrument.</s>

<s docid=AP900426-0135 num=39 wdcount=27> Discovery and its five astronauts will 
follow the telescope while controllers at the Goddard center make sure Hubble is 
operating properly, such as responding to directional commands.</s

<s docid=AP900424-0096 num=25 wdcount=36> On hand to watch the Discovery 
launching was a contingent of scientists who have hailed the Hubble as the 
greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes 
nearly 400 years ago.</s>

<s docid=AP900425-0146 num=14 wdcount=29> The $1.5 billion telescope began 
orbiting Earth every 97.3 minutes at an altitude of 380 miles _ high above the 
atmosphere, which has limited the view of ground-based telecopes.</s>

<s docid=AP900427-0146 num=36 wdcount=19> When the door opened, two of Hubble's 
four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working; later, engineers got them 
back on line.</s>

<s docid=AP900427-0146 num=45 wdcount=13> In addition to that trouble, there 
were two communications outages totaling several hours.</s>
