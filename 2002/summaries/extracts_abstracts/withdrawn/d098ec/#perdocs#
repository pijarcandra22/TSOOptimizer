The Discovery launch, now scheduled for Tuesday, will lift the 1.8 billion dollar Hubble 
Telescope into space. The countdown started Saturday. The shuttle's mechanical arm will 
lift the two-ton telescope from the shuttle on the mission's second day. Discovery will 
return to earth on Sunday, 29 April

There have been numerous delays in the program since its original 1983 launch date, but 
NASA's only actual launch attempt had to be aborted two weeks ago. The observatory, 
named for Edwin Hubble, is considered the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo 
first used a telescope.</SUM>

Air Force forecasters predicted the weather would be favorable for today's Discovery 
launch that will carry the Hubble Space Telescope. More than a half million gallons of 
liquid hydrogen and oxygen were pumped into Discovery after midnight. The five 
astronauts boarded at dawn.

Astronomers are excited about what the telescope can accomplish in space, and have 
been waiting for this day since 1983. The telescope will provide astronomers with ten 
times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based telescopes. 
Hubble is not expected to start providing significant scientific data by satellite until at 
least a month from now. </SUM>

The Discovery shuttle lifted off at 8:34 A.M. Tuesday, carrying the Hubble Telescope 
into an orbit 380 miles above the earth, higher than any previous shuttle. On Wednesday 
astronaut Steve Hawley will release the telescope into its own orbit for a 15- year stay in 
space.

The telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter, about the size of a railroad tank car. 
It has two mirrors, two cameras, two spectrometers, one photometer, and a pointing 
system that provides precise measurements. Internal batteries will provide power until the 
solar panels are extended to receive light from the sun.</SUM>

The early morning launch of the shuttle that carried the Hubble Space Telescope elated 
astronomers on hand for the event. It was the culmination of hopes held since 1983 when 
the launch was first scheduled.

The astronomers spoke out on their feelings. The Academic Affairs Director of the Space 
Telescope Science Institute at Johns Hopkins University called it "a perfect start to a 
great adventure for mankind". A University of Texas astronomer who is Hubble's 
Astrometry Project Leader spoke of the recurring periods of hope and depression since 
1983, and said "this is a time we are thrilled beyond belief".</SUM>

The Hubble Space Telescope was released from Discovery at 3:38 P.M. EDT as the 
shuttle entered its 20th orbit of the earth, nearly two hours and one orbit later than 
planned. The delay was caused by difficulty in getting one of the telescope's two solar 
wings unfurled. The unfurling of the panels eased the worries that the telescope's 
instruments would lack power.

The shuttle was 380 statute miles above the earth, higher than any shuttle had ever flown. 
The high orbit was necessary so that the telescope would be above the earth's distorting 
atmosphere.</SUM>

At 3:38 P.M. EDT on Wednesday the 1.5 billion dollar Hubble Space Telescope began 
orbiting the earth every 97.3 minutes at an altitude of 380 statute miles, high above the 
earth's atmosphere that limits earth-based telescopes. It took three attempts before the  
telescope's solar panels could be successfully unfurled. The astronauts were prepared to 
walk outside to manually free the panels if the third attempt had failed.

Hubble is the most complex and most expensive spacecraft ever built. Ground controllers 
who were monitoring Hubble said that no on-board problems had developed.</SUM>

Edwin Hubble, for whom the space telescope is named, was an astronomer who 
concluded in the 1920s that distant galaxies are moving away from the earth and at 
increasing speeds. This figures into the "Big Bang" theory of the shaping of the universe.

The Hubble Telescope is now sailing along above the earth, and astronomers' hopes are 
sky-high. They hope to see what no one has ever seen. The wonders of the earth's 
creation may be open to them. The Hubble Space Telescope is the biggest step forward in 
astronomy since Galileo first used a telescope.</SUM>

Today NASA controllers contacted the two main antennae on the Hubble Space 
Telescope. That success came on the third attempt. Engineers said the earlier failures 
were caused by the pointing of either Hubble or the orbiting communications satellite that 
acts as Hubble's switcboard. The next milestone comes Friday when the ten foot cover is 
opened, exposing the finely polished giant mirror to the starlight. Next Tuesday NASA 
hopes to receive the first image produced by Hubble.

Astronomers hope to use the telescope to study stars and galaxies so distant that their 
light has taken 14 billion years to reach earth.</SUM>

Ground controllers were relieved Thursday when they were able to make contact with the 
Hubble Space Telescope through its main antennae. Two earlier attempts had failed. The  
Hubble Project Manage acknowledged that controllers' lack of experience with the new 
satellite was part of the problem, but promised performance would improve and 
activation of the telescope would not be delayed.

The opening of Hubble's aperture door is scheduled for Friday morning. Discovery is 
now 57 miles behind Hubble, and if signals fail to open the door, two astronauts will 
leave Discovery and crank the door open.</SUM>

Thursday's successful opening of Hubble' lens cover paved the way for the astronauts to 
return to earth Sunday. Mission Control told them "the Hubble is open for business".

Hubble may be on its own but the telescope was still having problems. When the door 
opened, two of the four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped working, and the 
electronic system went into an automatic "safe-mode" in which all motion is stopped. 
Mission Control was proceeding cautiously as engineers do not want to jeopardize 
Hubble's usefulness. In its 15- year life Hubble is expected to help in determining the 
size and age of the universe.</SUM>

The Hubble Telescope orbited Friday with its big eye open, but a malfunction shut down 
its electronics. With Hubble on its own, Discovery was preparing for landing at 9:48 
A.M. EDT at Edwards Air Force Base.

NASA had planned to release its first test image from Hubble on Tuesday, but have 
announced that would be delayed by the malfunction. Officials at Goddard Flight Center 
sat they are proceeding cautiously to insure they do not impair the 1.5 billion dollar 
telescope. Hubble will be in space for 15 years, and they want to get it started right.</SUM>

Saturday morning controllers took the Hubble Space Telescope out of its "safe mode".
The telescope is running on a "normal control all mode", which means that its own 
computers and sensors guide where it is pointing. It was still without the use of its high- 
speed antennae, and its scientific instruments were on hold. Controllers are running a 12- 
hour computer program that monitors Hubble's health. It will be another day before the 
telescope is operating the way it is supposed to operate at this stage.

Winds at Edwards Air Force Base may delay Discovery's scheduled landing at Edwards 
Air Force Base.</SUM>
