Benazir Bhutto returned to Pakistan after many years in exile to take over
leadership of the Pakistan Peoples Party.  Her father had led that party and
was Prime Minister until overthrown, and later hanged, by General Zia
ul-Haq.  Free elections held after Zia was killed in a possibly sabotaged
plane crash, returned the PPP to power and made Benazir Prime Minister.
Pakistan thus became a fledgling democracy.  Benazir's opponents accused her
administration of nepotism, corruption, and ineptitude. The corruption
charge focused on her husband, Asif Zardari.  After less than two years, her
government was dismissed and she, her mother, and her husband faced possible
criminal charges.

Bhutto's husband was arrested, a move Benazir said was to intimidate her
during the campaign.  Both she and her husband were running for election.

Pakistani press called the feuding within Benazir's family, in which she
dismissed her mother as party co-chair, detrimental to the real problems of
the country.  The opposition members ended their boycott of the General
Assembly, and Benazir promised to discuss economic issues with them.  She
also re-vitalized the country's nuclear program, which she said was
necessary for Pakistan's defense, and which had been halted four years
earlier.</SUM>
